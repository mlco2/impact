                <p class="text-white-80">Progress in Machine Learning (ML) in recent years has been meteorical, with
                    major breakthroughs happening in domains such as machine translation, image recognition and
                    generation. While these advances are having widespread applications in many domains, detecting
                    cancers on X-rays
                    and improving the prediction of supply and demand,the carbon impact of ML training has not been a
                    central part of
                    the conversation until recently.</p>
                <p class="text-white-80">
                    Therefore, as ML practitioners who are also aware of the overall state of the environment, we find
                    that it is important to develop this conversion further and work towards building the tools we need
                    to assess the carbon emissions generated by the models we train, as well as ways to reduce those
                    emissions.</p>

                        We're currently working towards enabling you to compute your emissions when using a <strong>
                            private infrastructure</strong>. This would require either mapping cities to carbon emissions of
                        local grids or expecting our users (you) to input such a value. The mapping does not (?) exist for now (and for free), and we feel like
                        most users would not know the carbon efficiency of their electricity grid. This is why this is not yet available.
