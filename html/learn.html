                                    and nonrenewable energy sources. Renewable energy is collected from sources
                                    which
                                    are naturally replenished on a human timescale: this includes wind, sunlight,
                                    tides,
                                    geothermal heat, etc. In contrast, nonrenewable energy sources such as coal and
                                    petrol are not naturally replenished after their usage, and can take millions of
                                    years to be formed again. Finally, not all renewable energy sources are
                                    carbon-free,

                                    large companies is the purchasing of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs), which
                                    involves
                                    directly purchasing quantities of energy produced by renewable sources. This is
                                    considered to be an indirect of offsetting because in order to convert RECs into
                                    offsets, the energy purchased is translated into carbon reductions under the
                                    assumption that the clean energy is displacing an equivalent amount of
                                    electricity
                                    produced by non-renewable methods. Other commonly used forms of carbon

                                    include reforestation, sequestration, replacement of legacy equipment such as
